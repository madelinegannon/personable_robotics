## AATB / Superposition

[AATB](https://www.aatb.ch/) explores the idea of Non-Industrial Robotics: The studio is experimenting with industrial robotic systems such as robotic arms and industrial automation processes. It develops works engaging with Human-Machine Interactions through the lens of kinetic and interactive situations. Since 2020, the studio operates a Motion Control service for the film industry: [Superposition](https://www.superposition.ch/).

## Behnaz Farahi

[Behnaz Farahi](https://behnazfarahi.com/) is a designer, creative technologist and critical maker. Trained as an architect, she explores how to foster an empathetic relationship between the human body and the space around it through the implementation of emerging technologies. Her goal is to enhance the interaction between human beings and the built environment by following morphological, and behavioral principles inspired by natural systems.

## Dragan Ilic

The starting point in [Dragan Ilic's](https://www.draganilic.org/) work is conceptual analysis and de/reconstruction of the process of drawing as inscription of bodily activities on paper and opening the space for communication of ideas or realization of specific artistic intentions.

## Edward Ihnatowicz
[Edward Ihnatowicz](https://www.senster.com/ihnatowicz/) was a Cybernetic Sculptor active in the late 1960's and early 1970's. His ground-breaking sculptures explored the interaction between his robotic works and the audience, and reached their height with The Senster, a large (15 feet long), hydraulic robot commissioned by the electronics giant, Philips, for their permanent showplace, the Evoluon, in Eindhoven in 1970. The sculpture used sound and movement sensors to react to the behaviour of the visitors. It was one of the first computer controlled interactive robotic works of art.

## Golan Levin

[Golan Levin](http://flong.com/archive/index.html) is a media artist and educator developing artifacts and experiences which explore the expressive use of computation. His work focuses on the design of systems for the creation, manipulation and performance of simultaneous image and sound, as part of a more general inquiry into the formal language of interactivity, and of nonverbal communications protocols in cybernetic systems.

## Raising Robotic Natives

[Raising Robotic Natives](https://philippschmitt.com/archive/2018/work/robotic-natives.html) is designed to help us imagine what life will be like for children growing up with robots as a natural part of the household. This speculative design project by [Stephan Bogner](), [Philipp Schmitt](https://philippschmitt.com/archive/2018/work/robotic-natives.html) and [Jonas Voigt](https://jonas-voigt.com/Robotic-Natives) explores interactions between children and robots that could raise them as the first generation of robotic natives.

## Sougwen Chung

[Sougwen 愫君 Chung](https://sougwen.com) is a Chinese - Canadian artist & (re)searcher based in London / New York / Hong Kong. Chung's work explores the mark-made-by-hand and the mark-made-by-machine as an approach to understanding the dynamics of humans and systems.

## Studio Zoro Feigl

The installations of [Zoro Feigl](https://www.zorofeigl.nl/) (1983, Amsterdam) seem to be alive. His materials dance and twist. Placed together in a space, the separate works become one: large and ponderous in places, nervous or gracious elsewhere.

Feigl’s forms are constantly changing, sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly. Without beginning or end the objects seem to be locked into themselves. As a viewer you become entangled in their movements: they embrace and amaze, but sometimes also frighten you.
